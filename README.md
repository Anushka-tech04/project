# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Pushing to GitHub

To push your code to your own GitHub repository, please follow these steps.

1.  **Create a new, empty repository** on your GitHub account. For example, you can name it `my-threat-intel-app`.

2.  **Initialize Git in your project and add your files:**
    ```bash
    git init -b main
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

3.  **Update the remote URL to your new repository:**
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/AnuragRoy485/my-threat-intel-app.git
    ```
    (Remember to replace `my-threat-intel-app` with your actual repository name).

4.  **Push your code:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

This will work because you have permission to push to repositories that you own.
